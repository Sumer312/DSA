# Neetcode 150

#### [Longest common subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

- Example: text1 = "abcd" text2 = "affceed"
  ```
       a f f c e e d
     a *
     b   \ >
     c   v > *
     d         \ > *
  ```
- The answer is 3
- Explanation:
  - First you will traverse both the strings
  - If text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j) then increment both in next recursion call
  - Else increment one in one call and increment the other in the other call

#### [Longest palindromic subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

- Example: s = "hanna"
  ```
       a n n a h
     h v >
     a *
     n   *
     n     *
     a       *
  ```
- The answer is 4
- Explanation:
  - Same as the above question except the second string is just the first string reversed here

#### [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

- Example: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
- Explanation:
  - Similar to the two questions above.
  - Now first traverse the two strings using recursion
  - If the characters at indices are equal increment both the indices
  - Else there are 3 paths you can take
    - First you replace where you do a 1 + dfs(word1, word2, i + 1, j + 1)
    - Second you delete where you do a 1 + dfs(word1, word2, i + 1, j)
    - Third you insert where you do a 1 + dfs(word1, word2, i, j + 1)
  - If (i >= w1.length() && j >= w2.length()) { return 0; }

#### [Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

- Example: s = "226"
- Explanation:
  - There are basically two branches to the decision tree
  - One where you only consider the current character
  - The other where you consider the current character and the next character only if they do not exceed 26 i.e. 'Z'
  - The base considitons are that if idx >= s.length() return 1
  - And if s.charAt(idx) == '0' return 0 (because the string cannot be decoded if it starts with leading zeros)

#### [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

- Explanation:
  - First convert edges array to Map<Integer, Set\<Integer>> map
  - Then do a dfs on the map
    - If dfs returns true create a set named visited and add that node to that set, it means that the current course can be completed
    - While doing dfs if you encounter a node that has an empty set in map or a node that exists in the visited set (to optimize) then return true
    - While doing dfs if you encounter a node that is present in the seen set then return false because that means a cicrular dependency
  - While doing dfs on nodes 0 to numCourses if you encounter false even once return false else return true

#### [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

- Example: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
- Explanation:
  - Just look at the problem differently.
  - Instead of solving the problem from index 0 and going forward, go backwards.
  - By backwards I mean start at the 2nd last index beause that last index is our destination and also set a variable prev = nume.length - 1
  - Now if i + nums[i] >= prev then set prev to i
  - When loop is finished if prev == 0 return true else false
  - This approach has O(1) space and O(n) time
- Another approach with O(n) space and O(nk) time, (k is nums[i])
  ```java
  [2, 3, 1, 1, 4] (int)
  [T, T, T, T, T] (boolean)
  ```
  - Same as the above approach but here you initialize a boolean array and traverse backwards
  - The reason it is O(nk) is because inside the loop we have another loop
    ```java
    boolean[] flag = new boolean[nums.length]
    flag[flag.length - 1] = true;
    for(int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i++){
        int j = 0;
        while(j < 0){
            if(i + nums[i] - j > nums.length - 1 || flag[i + nums[i] - j]){
            flag[i] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return flag[0]
    ```
- This approach is just a little easier to understand for new folks

#### [Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

- Explanation:
  - Easy problem, just use a max heap
  - In the loop `while(!pq.isEmpty())` pop 2 elements from the heap
  - If after one element is popped the heap becomes empty just return the popped value
  - Else return 0 after loop

#### [Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

- Example:

  ```
  matrix =

  1  2  3
  4  5  6
  7  8  9
  ```

- Explanation:

  - First do a transpose of matrix in-place, (since in the test cases of this problem number of rows is equal to the number of columns of the matrix)
  - To do the transpose of a matrix in-place refer notes
  - This is what the matrix will look like after the transpose

    ```
    matrix =

    1  4  7
    2  5  8
    3  6  9
    ```

  - Now if you observe carefully you just have to swap the elements at matrix[i][j] with matrix[i]matrix[i].length - j - 1]
  - And that's it

    ```
    matrix =

    7  4  1
    8  5  2
    9  6  3
    ```

#### [Binary Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

```
            (1)
        /         \
      (4)         (7)
    /     \     /
  (2)     (9) (8)

Level order treversal =
[[1],[4,7],[2,9,8]]
```

- Explanation:
  - Very simple, initialize a queue of type TreeNode, add root to the queue
  - After that start the loop
  - Inside the loop declare a variable size and initialize it to queue.size()
  - Start a nested loop where the condition is size > 0
  - Add q.poll().val to a list and check if it has any left or right and if it does add those to the queue
  - Decrement the size variable
  - Pseudocode
    ```java
    List<List<Integer>> res = new LinkedList<>();
    Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.offer(root);
     while(!q.isEmpty()){
        int size = q.size();
        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
        while(size > 0){
            TreeNode temp = q.poll();
            list.add(temp.val);
            if(temp.left != null){
                q.offer(temp.left);
            }
            if(temp.right != null){
                q.offer(temp.right);
            }
            size--;
        }
        res.add(list);
    }
    ```

#### [Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

- First off read the question properly and if you do not understand come back to it later, honestly this was such an easy question that I had just ignored for the longest amount of time because I did not put effort into understanding the question
- Explanation:

  - The question is just asking you to give the right side view of the tree i.e the right most non null elements
  - The solution is simple, just do a level order traversal and then add the right most elements of the tree, i.e. the last element of every level to a list

    ```
                    (1)
                /         \
              (4)         (7)
            /     \     /
          (2)     (9) (8)

      Level order treversal =
      [[1],[4,7],[2,9,8]]

      Right Side View =
      [1,7,8]
    ```

#### [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

- There are 2 approaches to solve this problem, both use linear time, one uses constant space and other uses linear space
  - O(n) space approach
    - Very simple, just traverse the list and add each node into an arraylist
    - Then initialize 2 pointers i and j, i = 0 and j = list.size() - 1
    - Create a new ListNode dummy
    - dummy = new ListNode(0)
    - Now first attach the node at i and increment i and then attach node at j to dummy and decrement j
    - return dummy.next
  - O(1) space approach
    - Find the mid node in the list (fast and slow pointer approach)
    - Then store mid.next in another variable of type ListNode
    - Now do a dfs on the second half (the variable that stores mid.next) of the list using recursion and initialize a pointer to head
    - Now when you reach the last node assign last node to pointer.next and move the pointer to pointer.next
    - Now the function will return the the function above in the recursive call where the current node is second last node and do the same

#### [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

- Explanation:
  - Create 2 functions, findPivot() and binarySearch()
    ```
    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
           p
    [5,6,7,0,1,2,4]
         p
    [5,1,3]
     p
    ```
  - Here is how you find the pivot
    - ```java
       int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
       while(l <= r){
           int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
           if(m - 1 >= 0 && nums[m - 1] < nums[m] && m + 1 < nums.length && nums[m + 1] < nums[m]){
               return m;
           } else if(m - 1 >= 0 && nums[m - 1] > nums[m]){
               return m - 1;
           } else if(nums[l] > nums[m]){
               r = m - 1;
           } else {
               l = m + 1;
           }
       }
       return -1;
      ```
  - Now you search from (0 to p) and from (p + 1 to nums.length - 1)

#### [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

- Explanation:
  - Easy backtracking problem, traverse through the array
  - Add the current element to a list and do a recursive call
  - In the next call the loop should start from the beginning ( here there is no idx in the parameter )
  - To make sure that there are no duplicates add this check in the loop
  ```java
      if(list.contains(nums[i])){
          continue;
      }
  ```
  - One optimization you can make is use a hashset instead of a list because the problem specifies that there are no duplicates in the array

#### [Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

- Example s = "abab"

  ```
  list =
  ["a", "b", "a", "b"]
  ["a", "bab"]
  ["aba", "b"]

  res =
  [["a", "b", "a", "b"]
  ["a", "bab"]
  ["aba", "b"]]
  ```

- Explanation:
  - Backtracking problem, here we are going to have 2 functions, one is gonna be the recursive function and the other function will check if a string is a palindrome or not
  - The palindrome function is easy to implement
  - The recursive function's parameters are (String s, int idx)
  - Start a for loop where i = idx and inside the loop create a substring from idx to i
  ```java
  String sub = s.substring(idx, i)
  ```
  - If sub is a palindrome add sub to list and do a recursive call to the function and idx = i + 1
  - In the base condition you have
  ```java
  if(idx >= s.length()){
       res.add(new LinkedList(list));
       return;
  }
  ```

#### [Minimum Suffix Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-suffix-flips/)

- Explanation:
  - The starting string you have is consisting of all zeros you have to return the minimum number of moves to convert that to the target string given
  - So initialize 2 variables
  ```java
  int count = 0;
  char curr = '0';
  ```
  - Then traverse through the target string
  - If the current char in target is not equal to curr increment count and set curr to the current character in target
  - After the loop ends return the count

#### [Minimum operations to make binary array elements equal to one 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-ii/)

- Explanation:
  - Similar to minimum suffix flips, only here the premise is reversed, you are given some random string and you need to return the minimum number of operations you convert that string to a string containing all zeros

#### [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

- Explanation:
  - Here you have to just do an inorder traversal and declare and initialize a variable prev to Long.min_value and when the leftmost leaf or the smallest element is reached you have to check if the prev >= root.val
  - and if it is the return false
  - else prev = root.val
  - basically here we are checking if the inorder traversal of the tree is sorted

#### [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

- Explanation:

  - First learn how to detect anagrams
  - Here I will refer a string in the string array as word
  - Here you will also require a hashmap of <String, List\<String>\>
  - Now we traverse the string array
  - Then to group them what we do is we use an array of size 26 (because 26 alphabets) as a dict
  - After that we record each instance of a char in the word in the string array
  - Then we convert that array to a string
  - Then we use the hashmap and store the word in the string array in a list with the key being the dict string
  - If any other word has the same dict string then it will be added to them same list that is pointed to by the dict string
  - You cannot use the int[] directly as key because then the map will store the pointer to the array as the key and not the content of the array

- Example:
  ```java
  String s1 = "eat";
  String s2 = "tea";
  ```
  dict string of s1 = "10001000000000000001000000"\
   dict string of s2 = "10001000000000000001000000"

#### [Hand of Straights](https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/)

- Explanation:

  - Here you have to put all the unique digits of the array in a min heap and you also have to record the occurrences of all the digits using a map or an array
  - Now the idea is you peek the top element from the heap and then you run a loop from 0 to groupSize (given in params)
  - Now you pop one digit out of the heap, then you check if then polled digit is equal to the peeked digit + i and if it is not return false
  - Something like this

    ```java
      while(!pq.isEmpty()){
          int peek = pq.peek();
          for(int i = 0; i < groupSize; i++){
              int poll = pq.poll();
              if(poll != peek + i){
                  return false;
              }
          }
      }

    ```

  - Note: You will now get the solution if you yank and paste this code
  - Then you check if the digit has more than one occurrence, and if it does then just put it in a set or something and decrement its occurrence in the occurrence map
  - When the for loop ends add the elements back into the heap that are there in the set where you recorded the digits which had more than one occurrence
  - If everything executes and the while loop is exited return true

#### [Maximum sum circular subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/)

- Explanation:
  - Very import thing to remember here, when there is an array and you take out the maximum sum subarray from that array, then what you are left with is the minimum sum circular subarray
  - If the maximum sum subarray is circular then the minimum sum subarray is not
  - To solve this problem apply this principle
  - Calculate both the maximum sum subarray and the minimum sum subarray
  - Also calculate the total
  - Return the greater one of these two expressions
    - total - minimum_sum_subarray
    - maximum_sum_subarray
  - And also if the total and the minimum_sum_subarray are equal then just return the maximum_sum_subarray because if they are equal then that implies the entire array consists of only negative numbers and therefore the maximum_sum_subarray will have the largest negative number

#### [Single number 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

- Prerequisite: single number 1
- Example array : [1,2,1,3,2,5]
- Explanation:

  - In the first problem there was only one unique number, there there are 2
  - So to solve this do an normal XOR operation on the array and store the result in a variable say x.
  - Then find out the differing bit, what I mean by that is this

    - let's say the 2 unique numbers are 3 and 5,
    - 3 ^ 5 = 6
    - ```java
           3 = 011
           5 = 101
           therefore when we perform an xor we get
           0 1 1
           1 0 1
           -----
           1 1 0

           6 = 110
      ```

    - now here you can see that the differing bit is the MSB and the one to the right of it
    - we just care about finding one differing bit, could be anyone
    - the reason for it is that if we have that bit then every number that has a 1 will be separated into one group and every number that has a 0 will be separated into another group

  - So now we have the XORed bit which is 6
  - Now to find the differing bit we will keep performing an and operation between 1 and 6 until we find the differing bit

    - ```java
        // x = XORed bit i.e. 6
        int d = 1;
        while((x & d) == 0){
            d = d << 1;
        }
        /*
        d = 1   d = 2

        0 0 1   0 1 0
        1 1 0   1 1 0
        -----   -----
        0 0 0   0 1 0
        */
        // from the above operations we know that d = 2;
        // now traverse through the entire array
        int[] res = new int[2];
        Arrays.fill(res, 0);
        for(int i : arr){
            if((d & i) == 0){
                res[0] ^= i;
            } else {
                res[1] ^= i;
            }
        }
      ```

    - The reason why this works is because all 3 has 1 in its 2nd to the MSB place and 5 does not
    - So we just find the bit where both 3 and 5 differ and turn it into an int which is variable d
    - Now pay attention to the if condition. If we use that then res[0] will only perform an xor with the half that has 3 and some duplicates and 5 res[1] will perform xor with 5 and the other duplicates
    - Note that all the duplicate numbers will only be part of one group, i.e. if there are 2 occurrences of 2 then both of those occurrences will be XORed in res[0] only
    - One more thing, if you are confused about doing the AND operation to find the differing bit this might help
      - XOR basically means if a bit of the 2 operands are different then the corresponding bit of the result is 1 else 0
      - So to find which bit is 1 we keep doing an AND operation to the XORed bit until the result is not 0

#### [Generate parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

- Explanation:
  - Here you need to keep track of one thing, and this is a closed parentheses can only be added to the string if an open one already exists
  - So to do that we keep track of two variables 'o' and 'c'
  - Add an open parentheses to the string and decrement o
  - And if c > o i.e. there are more open parentheses in the current string than closed ones then you can add a closed parentheses and decrement c
  - Once both o and c are 0 then add the current string to the result list of type string.

#### [Remove all adjacent duplicates in string 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

- Explanation:
  - Use a monotonic stack for it
  - But not just any monotonic stack, the type of the stack should be int[]
  - This is to record the occurrence and store the character in int form i.e. ascii value in the stack
- Example:

  - s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
  - This is what will happen in the code

    1. First we keep adding the characters and their occurrence in the stack

    2. Now if the next 'e' is added then the occurrences of 'e' will be equal to k, therefore we need to pop out 'e' and add the elements after that
       | i=3 |
       |:---:|
       | e 2 |
       | e 1 |
       | d 1 |

    3. Now if we add the next 'c' the occurrences of 'c' will be equal k, therefore pop out 'c' and add the next characters
       | i=9 |
       |:---:|
       | c 2 |
       | c 1 |
       | b 2 |
       | b 1 |
       | d 2 |
       | d 1 |

    4. Same with 'b'
       |i=10 |
       |:---:|
       | b 2 |
       | b 1 |
       | d 2 |
       | d 1 |

    5. Same with 'd'
       |i=11 |
       |:---:|
       | d 2 |
       | d 1 |

    6. Now what you are left with is
       |i=13 |
       |:---:|
       | a 2 |
       | a 1 |

  - This is your answer

#### [Koko eating bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
- Explanation
    - So the brute force way is very simple
        1. Calculate the max value
        2. Then run a for loop from 1 to the max value
        3. In that for loop see with the current value of 'i' the hours it would take to finish the array
        4. You do that by nesting another loop inside the current loop where you traverse the array
        5. Now if the hours you have calculated with 'i' is equal to the hours specified in the params then just return 'i', if multiple 'i's give the same number of hours then return the minimum 'i'
    - Better approach
        1. Calculate the max value
        2. Here instead of running a for loop from 1 to max, observe that this is not an array, it's just a range from 1 to max which means it is sorted which intern means that binary search can be used here
        3. Therefore use binary search for it
